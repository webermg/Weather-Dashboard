# Weather-Dashboard

A dashboard showing current weather conditions and a future forecast. Cities that are searched are displayed in the main frame and logged to the history pane. Clicking on a city in the history pane will re-display that city's weather. The history is locally saved and upon page load the most recent city, if any, will be displayed. The app will maintain a legible appearance on screens down to Iphone size (375px wide). Searching by other parameters such as zip code or latitude/longitude is not possible currently.

Uses Materialize as the framework and OpenWeather for the data source.
